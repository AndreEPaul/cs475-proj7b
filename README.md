### Final Project for CS 475: Parallel Programming

##### This reads a long text file of floating point values and some a simple addition and multiplication array operation on the values. 
##### The point of the project is to do this with 4 approaches and test the runtime difference between all of them:
* Traditional approach using for-loops.
* Multithreaded for-loops using openMP.
* Single instruction multiple data approach.
* These same approaches ran on a GPU using openCL.
* Uses a bash script to run multiple tests. 

###### (TODO: some weird conversion happened with my script; fix this)
###### (TODO: insert the graphs from the results of these tests)
